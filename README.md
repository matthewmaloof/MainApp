    git clone https://github.com/matthewmaloof/MainApp.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd MainApp
    ```
3. If `FindMyIP` is not already included, add it as a Swift Package:
    ```sh
    xcodeproj add FindMyIP --path path/to/FindMyIP
    ```
4. Open the MainApp project in Xcode:
    ```sh
    open MainApp.xcodeproj
    ```
5. Build and run the `MainApp` target to see `FindMyIP` in action within the main application context.

## Usage

Launch the `MainApp` and you will be presented with the primary view from the `FindMyIP` library. Interact with the application as you would with the standalone `FindMyIP` app.
